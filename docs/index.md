Needs Content

### Scope

A DigitalOcean connection is scoped to a single DigitalOcean account, with a single set of credentials.

### Connection Configuration

Connection configuration is defined using HCL in one or more Steampipe config files. Steampipe will load ALL configuration files from `~/.steampipe/config` that have a `.spc` extension. A config file may contain multiple connections.

Installing the latest DigitalOcean plugin will create a connection file (`~/.steampipe/config/digitalocean.spc`) with a single connection named `digitalocean`. You must modify this connection to include your Personal Access Token for DigitalOcean account.

```hcl
connection "digitalocean" {
  plugin  = "digitalocean"
  token   = "17ImlCYdfZ3WJIrGk96gCpJn1fi1pLwVdrb23kj4"
}
```

### Configuration Arguments

The DigitalOcean plugin allows you set static credentials with the `token` argument. Personal access tokens function like ordinary OAuth access tokens -- You can use them to authenticate to the API by including it in a bearer-type authorization header along with your request. 

To use the plugin, you will need to [create personal access token](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/apis-clis/api/create-personal-access-token/).  Read scope is required (write is not).

If the `token` argument is not specified for a connection, the project will be determined as per the following order:
  - DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN environment variable, if set; otherwise
  - DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable, if set (this is deprecated).

#### Configuration Examples

- Using token to establish connection to a specific account.

  ```hcl
  connection "digitalocean_my_account" {
    plugin = "digitalocean"
    token  = "1646968370949-df954218b5da5b8614c85cc454136b27"
  }
  ```

- Common configuration having multiple connections to different DigitalOcean accounts.

  ```hcl
  connection "account_aaa" {
    plugin    = "digitalocean"
    token     = "1646968370949-df954218b5da5b8614c85cc4541abcde"
  }
  connection "account_bbb" {
    plugin    = "digitalocean"
    token     = "1646968370949-df954218b5da5b8614c85cc4541fghij"
  }
  connection "account_ccc" {
    plugin    = "digitalocean"
    token     = "1646968370949-df954218b5da5b8614c85cc4541klmno"
  }
  ```
